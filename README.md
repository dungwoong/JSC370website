# My JSC370 final project website

Should be [https://dungwoong.github.io/JSC370website/](https://dungwoong.github.io/JSC370website/)

The PDF report is [https://github.com/dungwoong/JSC370Final/blob/main/FinalWriteup.pdf](https://github.com/dungwoong/JSC370Final/blob/main/FinalWriteup.pdf)

Note that the code for the writeup was done in a [different repository](https://github.com/dungwoong/JSC370Final). This repository contains data collection scripts, and code for the final writeup. Check the README.md in that repository for more details. The code for the visualizations in this repository can be found in [HW5.Rmd](HW5.Rmd)

Data files can be found in the data/ folder. A description can be found [here](https://dungwoong.github.io/JSC370website/#Data_description) on the website, explaining where the data is sourced and how to reproduce it.
